### Hola Iam Maruti Khapare ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Maruti Khapare, a multi-skilled professional working at the intersection of UI Design, Marketing, and Human Resource Management. With a foundation in electronics engineering and hands-on experience in digital design, I'm driven by a simple goal â€” to make things work and look great while aligning teams and systems behind the scenes to scale that success.
Currently balancing dual roles as Marketing Manager and HR Manager across multiple companies, Iâ€™ve led everything from CRM and website development to influencer collaborations, international catalogue designs, and HR/payroll process optimization. Whether it's leading creative direction or building internal systems, I approach every project with a builderâ€™s mindset, a designerâ€™s eye, and a managerâ€™s discipline.
